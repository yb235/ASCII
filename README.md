## 🎯 Competition Strategy

The agent follows a strategic three-phase process:

1. **🔍 ANALYSIS PHASE**
   - Automatic image characteristic detection
   - Brightness, contrast, and complexity assessment
   - Strategic transformation planning

2. **🎭 TRANSFORMATION PHASE**
   - Analysis-driven tool selection
   - 2-3 complementary transformations
   - Creative effects for visual impact

3. **🖼️ ASCII CONVERSION PHASE**
   - Optimal character set selection
   - Dynamic sizing for best presentation
   - Professional framing and finishing

## 🧪 Advanced Features

### Intelligent Tool Selection
The AI agent automatically selects tools based on image analysis:
